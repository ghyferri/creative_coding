THE BREATHING ROOM üé®!
</h2> 

The Breathing Room is a unique space in the workplace that can be accessed at any time of the day. It is designed to provide a moment of respite from the daily grind, allowing you to take a deep breath and reset your mind.

Upon entering the Breathing Room, you will be guided through a short questionnaire that helps to create the right atmosphere for your mood. You will then be treated to a session of calming visuals and music, all narrated by Ivy's soothing voice.

The experience lasts about 7 minutes and is designed to help you leave the room feeling happy, relieved, and with a clear mind. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just need a quick break, the Breathing Room is the perfect place to unwind and recharge.

So why not take a few minutes out of your day to visit the Breathing Room and give your mind and body the break they deserve?

## :house: How it's build

### Box for buttons 

To make The Breathing Room interactive, we worked with push buttons. You answer questions using green and red push buttons. To present these buttons nicely without visible cables, we designed a box.

This box was made with a laser cutter. We used wood with a thickness of 6 mm for the box. We made the plan to cut out the box via makercase.com. This is a handy tool to enter your dimensions and get a plan in place. You can download the cut-out after you have entered everything. 

We download an svg file. We updated this file in Illustrator to add extra holes so that our cables could come out of the box and our push buttons could fit in.

The box consists of 5 panels. At the back, we have a small hole for the cables. At the top we have two holes to insert our push buttons. Tip: measure in advance how far apart the buttons should be. We made a mistake here at first. We used push buttons of 10 cm in size. 

To have this file read by the laser cutter, we need to save it as a dxf. You save it on a usb stick and upload it to the laser cutter.

The result is our 5 panels. This is what it looks like when assembled:

Since the box now looks bare and conspicuous, we made stickers. We used the same dimensions of the panels. The stickers were formatted in Adobe Illustrator. The right document for the printer is a pdf document. It is very important that your cut lines are in another layer. This layer should have a certain name (e.g. CutContour) and the 100% magenta. Below you can see our result.

To attach the push buttons to the box, you unscrew the bottom wheel of the button. You put the button through the hole and screw the wheel back on. This secures the buttons to the shelf (box).

HOW TO CONNECT THE BUTTONS TO RASPBERRY?

The plus, minus and zero cables were connected on the Raspberry (see above). On the other side of the cables hang the buttons. The cables were soldered to the plus, minus and zero ports on the buttons.
