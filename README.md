THE BREATHING ROOM ðŸŽ¨!
</h2> 

The Breathing Room is a unique space in the workplace that can be accessed at any time of the day. It is designed to provide a moment of respite from the daily grind, allowing you to take a deep breath and reset your mind.

Upon entering the Breathing Room, you will be guided through a short questionnaire that helps to create the right atmosphere for your mood. You will then be treated to a session of calming visuals and music, all narrated by Ivy's soothing voice.

The experience lasts about 7 minutes and is designed to help you leave the room feeling happy, relieved, and with a clear mind. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just need a quick break, the Breathing Room is the perfect place to unwind and recharge.

So why not take a few minutes out of your day to visit the Breathing Room and give your mind and body the break they deserve?
